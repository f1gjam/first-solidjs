# StravaStats frontend version 2.0

This is a new frontend I am working on for my applicaiton StravaStats. This is my first project using SolidJS/AG-Grid.

## Things left to do

- Table resize based on screen size
- URL environment variable... (remove any hardcoded stuff)
- Pagination on table??
- Styling on table and page
  - Ideally want arrows on Table headers indicated sorting direction.
- Contacts Page
- About Page
- Register Page
- Help Page
- Menu Links to dedicated tables
- Docker Image and deployment
